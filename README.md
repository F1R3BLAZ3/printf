# AirBnB clone - The console

The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. It wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

# First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This first step is very important because it will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end in

The AirBnB console is a command interpreter which acts like a minishell, and works in interactive and non-interactive mode.  

# How to Start the program:

# Commands:
create - create an object
show - show an object (based on id)
